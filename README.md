Project Management System - React Client
========================================

The React.js client for the [Project Management System](https://github.com/cpascoe95/project-management-system).

It's built as a demonstration of one possible way of using the MVVM design pattern with React.js. Subsequently, the focus is not on the HTML/CSS appearance of the application, but its structure and function.

This is part of a Uni assignment, and while it currently doesn't implement all of the desired functionality, it does demonstrate an interesting implementation of a React.js app.

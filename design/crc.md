Class Responsibility Collaborator Design
========================================

This is a high-level design of the classes that will be used by the client.

If a class extends another class, it will extend that class in the code, and as a result, inherit the responsibility of the class it extends from.

Data Access Classes
===================

Status Classes
--------------
There are a special set of Status classes, extending from a base `Status` class, that will be used to represent various response statuses.

If a class collaborates with the `Status` class, it means that it will be using any of the subclasses of `Status`. *(Needs further explanation)*
